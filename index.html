                It's not easy to get a cat to do anything, let alone hike around with you.  However I wanted to show you a what a day is like with my cat.  
                My name is Brian and the little critter next to me is Ben. And this is what a day hike looks like with Ben and I.

                    Coffee! I can't function without some sort of buzz.  So does the little guy here. Ben's enjoying a nice foamy french vanilla latte that I whipped up for him. 
                    Family secret recipe. Look at Ben's face. He sure looks happy with it.

                    Before we head out, Ben always loves to see his friends!  Can't get very far without him running off to say hello to a few people. 
                    I knew what I got myself into when I adopted the bugger and I was told he loves people.  Then again that's the kind of company I want around anyways.

                    Finally time to head out on our hike!  Ben has been telling me he wanted to see the ocean. So this hike we're gonna set out to the coast!  
                    I heard there were some big predators on the way there, so for safe measure I'm carrying a knife and shield.  Ben is carrying his trust walking stick. I told him it looked too big for him, but he didn't seem to mind.

                    Along the way to the ocean, we found friend who was spending his day fishing.  We decided to take a break from our hike and fish with him for a little while. 
                    Luckily he had a spare fishing rod with him and a floaty for Ben.  Ben finds the rods a bit too unwieldy, and prefers to fish up close and personal to the fishes.

                    Ack!! A monster! I knew there was a chance we'll see some danger along the path, but I didn't expect an Anjanath!  This guy could swallow us both whole!  
                    His roar was so loud that Ben and my ears were bleeding even after covering them with our paws.

                    Phew! We made a mad dash as far as we could away from the dreaded Anjanath and found some cover and shade.  I think it's time for a break! It's been a long day and Ben here is a bit tuckered out too.
                    Just a little rest and we'll be back on the trail to the ocean!

                    <img class=img-content src="images/coast.jpg" alt="Ben and his friend makes it to the ocean.">
                    We made it! We're at the ocean. It's such a lovely view from here. And the sounds of the waves crashing into the cliffside is quite relaxing. Soothing enough to heal our bleeding ears.  This was definitely worth the hike out.
                    Glad Ben made the suggestion to check out the ocean today.

                    After a long day I think its time we get a good nights rest. Got our tent pitched up under a beautiful starry night sky.  Think we'll do a little star gazing before hitting the hay. 
                    It's definitely been one crazy day, but that's what adventuring is all about!

                    I think our next big adventure will involve some snow.  We've been eyeing the mountains out in the horizon and I think it will be a fun and challenging hike to take. Plus neither of us has ever been up there so we get to explore more unseen wonders!
                    Of course we'll come prepared with some warm clothes too.
